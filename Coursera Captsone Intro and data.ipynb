    "Many students travel across the country for education, jobs, and to settle down. The main concern, whenever you move to a new city, is a house to stay in. Obviously, you will want to search for a good neighborhood, and this project, will give an idea as to how to select and what to choose, based on your requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of the population in India is middle class. Buying a real estate in a country as populated as India can be a real problem, especially when you have just started earning. Hence, rented apartments seem to be the new trend among the generation. The young generation does not prefer stability, and the short rent agreements allow you to move frequently. This analysis will also help the investors/ businessmen to decide where there is more scope.\n",

    "The main cities in India are also the centers for the migrants, always looking for jobs. Hence, there can never be shortage of employees. Depending on the stream of the business/startup (tech, sports centers, education hubs, restaurants, and transportation), the choice of a city differs.\n",
    " Pune is called as the education hub of India.\n",
    "Mumbai is the city of dreams, the city that never sleeps. \n",
    " Surat is called as the city of mirrors and mirages, a huge production centre.\n",
    " Delhi, the capital of the country, is rich in everything, the historical places, the culture, and has tremendous scope for the government jobs.\n",
    "The cities have mixed and intertwined structure. Comparing the nearby venues and the average rent values in each city, different categories of  groups of cities can be made .\n"
